					<p> Koi Palace - Basically the Elite/Sea Harbor of NorCal, but maybe operating at a higher level. Ridiculous crowds at dim sum, so come early. Probably the best dim sum in all of Northern California, but can be a tad heavy on MSG. Dinner? Lots of choices, not sure exactly where the strengths are beyond seafood but they are quite versatile. It's going to cost some money though.

                	<h3><a href="#">Sunnyvale</a></h3>
					<p>Shanghai Flavor Shop - they are most well known for 生煎包 "Shen Jian Bao" and probably the best in town. Some people prefer going somewhere else for this but to be honest those places don't specialize in this. SFS is very divey and literally "elbow grease" on the table. Not a date kind of place. I haven't been in a while but a friend says they are still good.</p>

                	<h3><a href="#">Fremont</a></h3>
					<p>Yum's Bistro - out of the way, but the chef there is legendary amongst Cantonese expats. Master of crab, lobster, seafood, stir fry, and lots of classical old style recipes. Order from the white board or pre-order in advance from the last page of the menu. This is a restaurant requiring several trips, and bring several folks with you, and be very patient since the kitchen is small and he only has one assistant.</p>

        	<h2>Choosing a friendly atmosphere</h2>
			<p>The atmosphere in a fine dining establishment is one of the keys to its perceived value. The lights need to soften the mood; the music should reflect the concept yet not overpower guest conversations; the décor should add an elegant and unique perspective. Overall, fine dining establishments strive to create an exceptional dining experience for guests.</p>

                <h4>Go-To: San Francisco</h4>
			<p>One of the nicest things about visiting San Francisco is that, although the city is “big” in terms of attractions and amenities, it is geographically small – only 49 square miles. Consequently, it is very easy to see and do a great many things in a short period of time.</p>
